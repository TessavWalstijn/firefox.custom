# Contributing Guidelines

## Working With Issues

If you find an issue you would like to work on, comment on it, and a maintainer will respond and assign it to you. Only work on changes and create a PR after it's assigned to you.

**We only accept PRs from contributors who get assigned to the issues**.

Or had confirmation via an other medium. (Please have that clip when it was via a video format)
